# MadLibGame
Made for Computer Programming in February 2026, a Mad Lib Game based off of the game Deltarune by Toby Fox.

This was a solo project done by me(yes I know we were supposed to do group work but it really just didn't work out.)
I think my biggest challenge in the project was coming up with the stories but eventually I got the idea to base it off of vessel creation in chapter one of Deltarune. I figured it'd be fun to have a situation where you get told by the narrator what becomes of your vessel instead of it just being discarded.
